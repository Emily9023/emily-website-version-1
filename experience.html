                    <h4>West End YMCA, Toronto, ON</h4>
                    <p> As a lifeguard/swimming instructor, I am responsible for maintaining safety in the 
                        facility and for providing high-quality in-water swim lessons for all ages, including 
                        students with special needs. I keep clients safe, I am required to maintain my training 
                        to handle emergency situations.
                        I have learned to identify and resolve problems efficiently and communicate effectively 
                        to build strong interpersonal relationships. Due to the demands of my job, I provided 
                        quality customer service by always positively interacting with my clients to build 
                        relationships and trust. My exposure to a variety of different ages has allowed me to 
                        gain experience effectively communicating to accommodate a variety of different people. 
                        In addition, I gained experience working with a team to identify and minimize hazards 
                        within the environment through creative problem solving and critical thinking.

                    <p> The Blue Sky Solar Racing team is a student-led design team that constructs 
                        and designs solar-powered vehicles. The team encompasses a variety of diverse 
                        talented students comprising of 7 subteams, I am a member of the mechanical 
                        subteam. The team provides attention to design sustainable vehicles and 
                        delivers valuable technical training that bridges theoretical knowledge from 
                        schooling to practical hands-on experience. 

                        As a member, I help in designing parts for the car as well as running 
                        simulations to ensure that the parts are safe. As a team member, I am 
                        required to use CATIA, a CAD software, to provide a 3D modeling prototype 
                        of the part. Using ANSYS, I run simulations on the part to check if the part 
                        is able to withstand the force load with acceptable safety.

                        concrete toboggan. The toboggan is raced against toboggans all over Canada, 
                        testing for speed, steering and braking as well are spirit-sided components 
                        such as theme design. 

                        As a costumes lead, I am required to design, order, and manufacture 30 
                        costumes that represent the theme of the concrete toboggan. This role is 
                        important to create a sense of spirit and cohesion within the team. Aside 
                        from my delegations as a spirit lead, I am fully immersed in the work of the 
                        design side; I partake in design lead meetings, providing input and help 
                        design and brainstorm for the concrete toboggan.
